ABOUT

Gridiculous is a simple utility script for creating guide grids in Adobe
Photoshop CS5. The script allows you to define values for column count, column
width and gutter width. The grid can be inserted to any open document
or to a new document.

Note: this script works only in Photoshop CS5 since the Guides object is not
accessible through the Photoshop API in older versions of Photoshop. This script
has only been tested with Adobe Photoshop CS5 in Macintosh environment.


INSTALLATION

1. Download Gridiculous-1.0a.jsx and place it in the Scripts folder
(Photoshop CS5/Presets/Scripts/).
2. If you installed the script while Photoshop was running, relaunch Photoshop
in order to make the script accessible.


USAGE

In Photoshop, select File > Scripts > Gridiculous
