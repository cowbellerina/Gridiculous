ABOUT

Photoshop. The script allows you to define values for column count, column
width and gutter width. The grid can be inserted to the frontmost open document
or to a new document.

Note: this script has only been tested with Adobe Photoshop CS5 in Macintosh
environment. Additional testing will take place in the near future.
